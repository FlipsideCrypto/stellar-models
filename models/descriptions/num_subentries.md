{% docs num_subentries %}
The total number of ledger entries connected to this account. Ledger entries include: trustlines, offers, signers, and data entries. (Claimable balances are counted under sponsoring entries, not subentries). Any newly created trustline, offer, signer or data entry will increase the number of subentries by 1. Accounts may have up to 1,000 subentries.
