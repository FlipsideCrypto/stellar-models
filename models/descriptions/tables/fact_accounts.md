{% docs core__fact_accounts %}

The accounts table stores detailed information for a given account, including current account status, preconditions for transaction authorization, security settings and account balance. The balance reported in the accounts table reflects the accountâ€™s XLM balance only. All other asset balances are reported in the 'trust_lines' table. Any changes to the account, whether it is an account settings change, balance increase/decrease or sponsorship change will result in an increase to the account sequence_number and last_modified_ledger. The sequence_number is incremented with each operation applied to an account so that order is preserved during account mutation.
