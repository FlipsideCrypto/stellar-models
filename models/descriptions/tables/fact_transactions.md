{% docs core__fact_transactions %}

Transactions are commands that modify the ledger state and consist of one or more operations. In terms of taxonomy, a ledger contains a transaction set of multiple transactions, and a transaction contains an operation set of one to many operations. Transactions that are sent to the Stellar Network either succeed completely or fail completely. There is no partial transaction execution. The table is an event log of all transactions submitted and committed to a transaction set within a ledger.
