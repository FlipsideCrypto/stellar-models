{% docs core__dim_assets %}

Table reports which assets are used during the batch interval, which can help identify periods of time of large activity for an asset. The table does not have a primary key and assets are duplicated in the table as they are used during different periods of time. To get a distinct count of assets on the network, please refer to the history_assets table. Table not widely used.
