{% docs rounding_slippage %}
Applies to liquidity pool trades only. With fractional amounts of an asset traded, the network must round a fraction to the nearest whole number. This can cause the trade to "slip" price by a percentage compared with the original offer. Rounding slippage reports the percentage that dust trades slip before executing.
